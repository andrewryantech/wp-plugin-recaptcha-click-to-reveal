# Click-to-reveal: A Google Invisible reCaptcha-based wordpress plugin 
A simple little wordpress plugin to prevent spam bots from scraping personal details from your site. 

On page load, the site renders a placeholder, prompting the user to click it. Once clicked, the plugin leverages the Google reCaptcha API to verify their humanity, before revealing the protected information.

## TODO
- [ ] Would be nice if once authenticated as human, the user does not need to re-authenticate.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, I try to action them within a day or two.
