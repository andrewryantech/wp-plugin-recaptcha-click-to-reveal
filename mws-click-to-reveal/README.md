Prevent spam-bots from harvesting your email address or other sensitive information form your website by requiring 
users to click to reveal the information.

== Description ==

The plugin leverages Google's invisible reCaptcha technology. These keys must be input via the plugin's 
admin integrations page.

The main admin page enables admins to manage a list of key/value pairs, where the key is the name of the pair, and the 
value is the protected value that should only be revealed once a user has proved they are human.

When editing post/page content, a TinyMCE integration enables the post author to click a button to generate a shortcode.
The author will be prompted to select the pair they wish to render, along with a initial value to display.

When the page is rendered, the initial value is rendered into the page. Users can click the initial value to reveal the
protected value.
